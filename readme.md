# goaccesscharts

Tool to render alternative html reports for [goaccess](https://goaccess.io) output. WIP.

Charts are generated as SVG and the report can be viewed without any JavaScript.

## Why

- no JavaScript
- much, much smaller HTML files compared to the `goaccess` output.

## Usage

The application reads a json file generated by `goaccess` from `stdin`
and writes HTML to `stdout`.

```
goaccesscharts < data.json > report.html
```
